# Java Learning Roadmap

## Overview
Welcome to my Java learning journey! This repository contains daily progress updates, code samples, and exercises as I learn Java step by step. Each day corresponds to a folder (`Day-1`, `Day-2`, etc.) containing relevant Java code and notes.

## Learning Plan (1 Hour Per Day)
I will follow this structured plan to learn Java effectively. Each day, I will complete the topics listed below and check them off as I progress.

### Week 1: Java Foundations (Refresher & Strong Core)
- [x] **Day 1**: Java Basics – Data Types, Variables, Operators, Input/Output
- [ ] **Day 2**: Control Flow – If-Else, Switch, Loops (for, while, do-while)
- [ ] **Day 3**: Advanced Loops – for-each, Nested Loops, Break/Continue
- [ ] **Day 4**: Methods – Defining, Calling, Parameters, Return Types
- [ ] **Day 5**: Arrays & ArrayLists – Iteration, Manipulation, Multi-dimensional Arrays
- [ ] **Day 6**: String Handling – StringBuilder, String Methods, Formatting
- [ ] **Day 7**: Review & Hands-on Project – Build a Console-Based Java App

### Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (Deep Dive)
- [ ] **Day 8**: Classes & Objects – Creating and Using Objects in Java
- [ ] **Day 9**: Constructors, Method Overloading & Static Keyword
- [ ] **Day 10**: Inheritance – Superclass, Subclass, Method Overriding
- [ ] **Day 11**: Polymorphism – Compile-Time vs Runtime, Upcasting & Downcasting

### Week 3: Modern Java (Generics, Collections, Streams)
- [ ] **Day 15**: Generics – Generic Methods, Classes, Type Inference
- [ ] **Day 16**: Collections Framework – List, Set, Map, Queue & Iterators
- [ ] **Day 17**: Functional Programming – Lambda Expressions & Method References

- [ ] **Day 21**: Review & Hands-on Project – Implement a Library Management System

### Week 4: Concurrency, Database & Web Development
- [ ] **Day 22**: Multithreading – Threads, Runnable, Executor Service
- [ ] **Day 23**: JDBC – Connecting Java with MySQL/PostgreSQL
- [ ] **Day 24**: REST APIs – Introduction to Spring Boot & Building a Basic API
- [ ] **Day 25**: Spring Data JPA – Database Operations with Spring
- [ ] **Day 26**: Microservices Basics – Service Communication, API Gateway
